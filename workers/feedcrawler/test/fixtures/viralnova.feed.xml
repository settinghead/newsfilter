				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Millions of people are living in informal settlements all across South Africa called shanty towns, these shanty settlements consist of thousands of houses referred to as shacks or shantys. At first glance, these photos below seem to offer a glimpse into the harsh lives of the millions of people living in extreme poverty in South Africa. But that&#8217;s not the case.</p>
<p>The shacks pictured below are all part of a highly controversial resort that offers tourists the experience of sleeping inside a metal hut for a mere $82 a night.</p>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/shanty-town-resort/shanty_town_resort_01/'><img width="790" height="422" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shanty_town_resort_01.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="Located near Bloemfontein in South Africa, the shanty town themed luxury resort operated by Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa looks like a slum." /></a>

A real shanty town hut will often have two full families living together in one. The sleeping arrangements don’t exactly scream “luxury” but they are a hundred times better than inside a real shanty town hut." /></a>
<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/shanty-town-resort/shanty_town_resort_10/'><img width="790" height="422" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/shanty_town_resort_10.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="The operator says that the idea was born after &quot;regular overseas visitors suggested that they would like to sleep in a real shanty rather than just seeing them from a tour bus, as you would in Soweto and Cape Town&quot;." /></a>

<p>The insensitivity of turning millions of peoples&#8217; suffering, misfortune and disgraceful quality of life into a novelty attraction is somewhat shocking. Here&#8217;s the video from their YouTube channel:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of the amazing (and slightly terrifying) artwork you&#8217;re about to see was created by one man. His name is <a href="http://www.samjinks.com/" target="_blank">Sam Jinks</a> and he is an Australian visual artist. He focuses on creating hyper-realistic sculptures out of silicone, resin and fiberglass. There&#8217;s something about these pieces that are almost <em>too</em> realistic, to the point where they seem like they shouldn&#8217;t exist at all.</p>
<p>No matter how you feel about his artwork, one thing is certain: you should feel something.</p>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/sam-jinks/'><img width="600" height="399" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="Although most of his pieces are seemingly very normal..." /></a>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/sam-jinks4/'><img width="600" height="901" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks4.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="sam jinks4" /></a>
<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/sam-jinks5/'><img width="600" height="318" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks5.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="sam jinks5" /></a>

It isn&#039;t gruesome, but many people react to it." /></a>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/sam-jinks9/'><img width="600" height="756" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks9.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="After adding the silicone and resin, he will add coloring and hair to make the sculptures seem so lifelike." /></a>
<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/sam-jinks10/'><img width="600" height="450" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks10.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="Most of them you wouldn&#039;t be able to tell aren&#039;t human..." /></a>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/hyper-realistic-artist-sam-jinks/s/'><img width="600" height="800" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sam-jinks12.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="It will be hard to forget any of Sam Jinks&#039;s work." /></a>

<p>Some of Sam&#8217;s works fall into what people call the &#8220;uncanny valley.&#8221; The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">uncanny valley</a> is a hypothesis in the field of human aesthetics. The idea is that when human features look and move <em>almost</em>, but not <em>exactly</em>, like natural human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among some human observers.</p>
<p>So when you look at some of Sam&#8217;s work, and you (for almost no reason) are put off by it&#8230; it could be because his hyper-realistic sculptures step too close into this uncanny valley.</p>
<p>The humans with fox heads, for example, may be culprits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think of beautiful gems, your mind may automatically drift to a diamond, ruby or emerald. One gemstone, however, that doesn&#8217;t nearly get the attention it deserves is the opal. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal" target="_blank">opal</a> is one of the most beautiful of gemstones, found in limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl and basalt. These stones can be almost any color, and opals of different colors can flash different colors in different lights. They&#8217;re truly amazing. You can find precious opals that are clear through white, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, rose, pink, slate, olive, brown, and black.</p>

<p>Opals seem otherworldly. They come in so many colors and can change their appearance right in front of you. Forget diamonds, engagement rings should have opals in them. Amazing. </p>

<p>I wonder how many people got opals this Valentine&#8217;s Day&#8230; did you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the foot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Arayat" target="_blank">Mount Arayat</a> in the Philippines stands a large, pyramid-shaped structure. It&#8217;s called Bale Batu, and it is the creation of a local artist named Jesus Padilla. The man, called Apung Susing by his fellow artists, spent years working on Bale Batu. Literally, for more than half of his life, he worked on building this temple. The result was something you&#8217;d never expect.</p>

<a href='http://www.viralnova.com/artist-built-temple/built-temple/'><img width="600" height="340" src="http://cdn.viralnova.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/built-temple.jpg" class="attachment-full" alt="Jesus created the temple using cement and pulverized mountain rocks." /></a>

But the artists was determined." /></a>

Even though there have been earthquakes in the area, they have not toppled Bale Batu." /></a>

He ate that meal... and took his last breath. Bale Batu became his own grave." /></a>

<p>At the end of it all, after spending four decades building this beautiful temple, it became Apung Susing&#8217;s own burial ground. Although that is sad, it&#8217;s also beautiful to know that he will forever rest in the temple that he loved so much and built his life around (literally).</p>

<p>The fact that there have been <em>actual fatalities</em> at the site would lead me to believe that people would stop jumping in, but of course they don&#8217;t. So if you&#8217;re ever in this area of Texas and wish to take a quick (dangerous) dip, head over to Jacob&#8217;s Well!</p>

Because located under one of the leaves was a tiny little caterpillar, enjoying a healthy green lunch.</p>
<p>Her apartment building sadly doesn&#8217;t allow pets, and she&#8217;s always wanted an animal to care for, so she adopted the little caterpillar and watched it transform into a beautiful butterfly over the space of 5 weeks.</p>

<p>Miss_beat says she apologizes for the state of her fingernails in some of the pictures, she didn&#8217;t realize at the time they were that dirty. But she shared these pictures anyway since she thought John deserves to be seen in all his glory, despite her work-grubby hands.</p>
